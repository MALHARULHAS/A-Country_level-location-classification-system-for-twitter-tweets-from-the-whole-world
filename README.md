# Country_level-location-classification-system-for-twitter-tweets-of-the-whole-world

Description

This contains some datasets &amp; classification code.

The countries represented are from 0 to 248. 300 is no country defiined. see file modified_country_list.txt.

The last coloum is the country it predicted.

# How To Run The Code

I have use Python 3.6 Spyder IDE in Anaconda Navigator.

To run this code you just have to bring this code in to the SPYDER IDE.

Now there are a total of nine classifiers given in the code, to run each one just remove the (''') apostrophes (the starting & the ending ones for each classifier code). 

Once you are done training & testing using one classifier and then you want to use another put back the apostrophes to the former one and remove the apostrophes of the next classifier code which you might want to run.

For every code you run it generates the confusion matrix and entire summary see it in the “confusion_matrix_imgs” folder in the “MALHAR_IMPLEMENTATION_CODE” directory.

You can find the documentation page attached.
